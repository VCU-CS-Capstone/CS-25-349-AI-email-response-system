# *AI-Powered Email Response System Using Fine-Tuned LLMs for Customer Service in React*
## *CoStar Group*
## *Short Project Description*
This project aims to develop a React-based web application that leverages fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist customer service teams in generating professional email responses. The system integrates with existing customer service platforms to provide AI-generated, contextually relevant responses to customer inquiries, significantly reducing response times while maintaining high-quality communications.

The AI-generated responses are designed to be reviewed and edited by customer service agents, allowing for human oversight and ensuring appropriateness. The project also incorporates a feedback mechanism where users can rate the AIâ€™s suggestions, improving the model's performance over time.

The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project.
