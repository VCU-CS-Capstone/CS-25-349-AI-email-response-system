# *AI-Powered Email Response System Using Fine-Tuned LLMs for Customer Service in React*
## *CoStar Group*
## *Short Project Description*
This project aims to develop a React-based web application that leverages fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist customer service teams in generating professional email responses. The system integrates with existing customer service platforms to provide AI-generated, contextually relevant responses to customer inquiries, significantly reducing response times while maintaining high-quality communications.

The AI-generated responses are designed to be reviewed and edited by customer service agents, allowing for human oversight and ensuring appropriateness. The project also incorporates a feedback mechanism where users can rate the AIâ€™s suggestions, improving the model's performance over time.
